# S3.02 - Java Patterns 🧩

## 🧾 Task Objectives
- Understand the **concept and purpose of design patterns** in software engineering.
- Learn how to **implement three fundamental design patterns in Java**:
    - **Singleton Pattern** → ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.
    - **Factory Pattern** → creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.
    - **Strategy Pattern** → defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates them, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.
- Practice **modular and reusable software architecture** by separating object creation, behavior, and logic.
- Reinforce concepts of **abstraction, encapsulation, and dependency management** in Java.

This activity focuses on understanding how design patterns **improve maintainability, scalability, and flexibility** in Java applications.
